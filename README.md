# Operating System Configuration

Setting up a Windows10 for Development

## Getting Started

In [windows-10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) at first I got some issues there are - 

1. Wrong keyword typing in "Keyboard"
2. Driver install **Touchpad , Graphics, Audio, etc.** Its depends on what types of Brand Laptop/PC you are using. Just google it by your Brand name and install by Brand official tools like [Lenovo](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/bd/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/300-series/320-15isk/downloads/automatic-driver-update)
3. File explorer tab install. [See how?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt5JpnF4hW0)
