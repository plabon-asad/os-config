## Linux setup by WSL in Windows-11

Trying to config [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) without leaving Winodows by [WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)

### Prerequisites
There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing around with WSL.
- `Turn Windows features on or off` by search Windows bar
- Enables the optional `WSL`, `Virtual Machine Platform`, `Hyper-V` , `Virtual Mechine Platform`, `Windows Sandbox` components by checked it and need to restart your mechine.
- Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel
- Sets WSL 2 as the default
- Downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution (reboot may be required)

Open cmd terminal for use these commands step by step.
### Basic commands for WSL
Command | Description and Link
------------ | -------------
`wsl --status` | Check WSL status.
`wsl --install` | Install WSL and the Ubuntu distribution of Linux.
`wsl --install --distribution <Distribution Name>` | Install a specific Linux distribution
`wsl --install --distribution <Distribution Name>` | Designate a distribution of Linux for installation besides the default (Ubuntu) by replacing `<Distribution Name>` with the name of the distribution. This command can also be entered as: `wsl -d <Distribution Name>`.
`wsl --list --online` or `wsl -l -o` | List available Linux distributions at online.
`wsl --list --verbose` or `wsl -l -v` | See a list of the Linux distributions installed on your Windows machine, including the state (whether the distribution is running or stopped) and the version of WSL running the distribution (WSL 1 or WSL 2). Comparing WSL 1 and WSL 2. Additional options that can be used with the list command include: `--all` to list all distributions, `--running` to list only distributions that are currently running, or `--quiet` to only show distribution names.
`wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>` | To designate the version of WSL (1 or 2) that a Linux distribution is running on, replace `<distribution name>` with the name of the distribution and replace `<versionNumber>` with 1 or 2. Comparing WSL 1 and WSL 2.

`wsl --set-default <Distribution Name>` | Set default Linux distribution
`wsl ~` | Change directory to home
`explorer.exe .` | See full-path of WSL/Windows11 by terminal. Open terminal which one you want to see and run command, a folder will open with required path.

Basic commands details [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands) here you can see and learn also more.

<br>**üìçTo navigate to any-drive in bash on WSL2-Ubuntu18.04!** [Link here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/831361/can-i-change-directory-to-a-windows-drive-in-ubuntu-bash-on-wsl)

WSL stores your Windows drives in the `/mnt` folder, with the name of the drive as a subfolder. For example your `C:\` drive will be present at `/mnt/c/` for you to use. Keeping this in mind, you can swap to your specific folder like so `cd /mnt/e/username/folder1/folder2`

### Setup development environment

Command | Description and Link
------------ | -------------
`sudo apt-get update` | Update Ubuntu
`sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev` | First some dependencies for Ruby

### Install `rvm` - [Help link](https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm)

1. You need ***software-properties-common*** installed in order to add **PPA** repositories.
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```

2. Add the PPA and install the package
```
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rvm
```

3. Add your user to rvm group ($USER will automatically insert your username)
```
sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER
```

4. If you cannot force terminal to perform a login, or you're facing `Command 'rvm' not found`, you can run the following command to append it to your `.bashrc`
```
echo 'source "/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

5. Now rebot your terminal and check status by run `rvm -v`

### Install Ruby
Some necessary command of `rvm`. To see available version from online`rvm list known`, installed list of ruby`rvm list`, current using version`rvm current`, install latest version of ruby `rvm install ruby`, installed specific version of ruby `rvm install ruby_version_number` like `rvm install 2.3.1`

‚õëÔ∏è If broken any installation of ruby for week network or any other reasons, you can fix it by ***reinstallation*** by `rvm reinstall ruby_version_number`. Before it you should restart the mechine.


### Install Node.js by NVM - [Help Link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Before piping the command through to bash, it is always a good idea to audit the script to make sure it isn‚Äôt doing anything you don‚Äôt agree with. You can do that by removing the | bash segment at the end of the curl command
``` 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh
```

Review the output and make sure you are comfortable with the changes it is making. Once you‚Äôre satisfied, run the same command with | bash appended at the end. The URL you use will change depending on the latest version of NVM, but as of right now, the script can be downloaded and executed by running the following
``` 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the nvm script to your user account. In order to use it, first source the .bashrc file
``` 
source ~/.bashrc
```
First, ask nvm what versions of Node are available
``` 
nvm ls-remote
```

Install a specific version of node
```
nvm install v16.13.1
```

After done check status `node -v`

Install a specific version of Rails `gem install rails -v version_number`
```
gem install rails -v 7.0.2.4
```

### Install Mysql, Apache, PhpMyadmin in WSL2-Ubuntu18.04! [Link here](https://geekrewind.com/how-to-install-phpmyadmin-on-windows-11-wsl/)
 1. Install Apache HTTP Server
 2. Install MariaDB Database Server
 3. PHP and Related Modules
 4. Install phpMyAdmin
<br> 

1. To install Apache on Ubuntu `sudo apt install apache2`. After done, use command to stop, start and restrat **Apache2**: `sudo service apache2 stop`, `sudo service apache2 start`, and `sudo service apache2 restart`.
2. To install MariaDB, run the commands below: `sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client`. After installing MariaDB, the commands below can be used to stop, start and restart MariaDB services `sudo service mysql stop`, `sudo service mysql start`, and `sudo service mysql restart`.<br><br>
Next, run the commands below to secure the database server with a root password if you were not prompted to do so during the installation 
```sudo mysql_secure_installation```
  When prompted, answer the questions below by following the guide.
  - Enter current password for root (enter for none): Just press the Enter
  - Set root password? [Y/n]: Y
  - New password: Enter password
  - Re-enter new password: Repeat password
  - Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y
  - Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y
  - Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]:  Y
  - Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]:  Y <br>
 To verify and validate that MariaDB is installed and working, login to the database console using the commands below: `sudo mysql -u root -p`
3. PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that enables the LAMP and LEMP stack and is required by phpMyAdmin.To install PHP and recommended modules, run the commands below: `sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-common php-mysql php-gmp php-curl php-intl php7.2-mbstring php-xmlrpc php-gd php-xml php-cli php-zip`<br>
To verify php version write: `php -v`
4. Now that you have installed Apache, MariaDB and PHP, run the commands below to install phpMyAdmin `sudo apt install phpmyadmin`.<br>
When prompted to choose the webserver, select apache2 and continue. When prompted again to allow debconfig-common to install a database and configure select Yes.

Enter a password and confirm for phpMyAdmin to register with the database, then select OK and complete the installation. MySQL and MariaDB come with a feature that provides root authentication via a **auth_socket plugin**.<br><br>This plugin authenticates users who connect from the localhost via socket file without prompting or using a password. If you attempt to logon to phpMyAdmin with the MariaDB root account, you won‚Äôt be allowed.<br><br>If you wish to use the root account to logon to phpMyAdmin, then use the steps below. To fix that, you‚Äôll need to change the default authentication mechanism from auth_socket to mysql_native_password.<br><br>Login back into MariaDB console `sudo mysql`.

Then run the commands below to change to disable **mysql_native_password** module.
```
USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET plugin='' WHERE user ='root';
```
The save your changes and exit:
``` 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```
Restart **Apache** and browse to phpMyAdmin web portal using the URL: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
